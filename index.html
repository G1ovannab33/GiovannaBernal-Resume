        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Giovanna Bernal, I am in the pre-business major, later on switching into Business Administration.<br><br>

        I am currently a student at the University of California of Riverside. My experience at this school has been great so far and I have been keeping up with my classes. My goal is to start up a business of varieties of drinks, such as a morning coffee, a refreashing lemonade, and more, as well having food options to go with these beverages. I want to give back to the community and satisfy the customers with these products, making their day better with flavorful drinks and snacks. This is a reason why I chose business, to learn on how to manage one and probably start up on in the future. I am a very deticated person wanting to learn more, inspire others, and grow. I deticated much of my time to my studies that I was able to graduate High school with an Associate degree in Social and Behavriol Sciences, as well I had finished my general education for college. During high school, at Nuview Bridge Early College High school, I was part of the golf team and a club volleyball team, was in the latinos unidos club, was a manager for boys and girls volleyball, I also got certifed to do Lash Extensions, I was apart of the valedictorian circle and did theater shows.<br><br>

        Some the responisbilities I had during my experiences was being able to work as a team, being a leader and helping out those who seeked it, pacience, mutlitasking, good time managemnet, good communication skills, accept others input into renuvating ideas or inviting others to join our club, cash managing, and applying statagies to make my team better. Some of the stuggles I had during this time was really knowing how to manage my time wisely, as a part time student, college student, team mate, manager, being part of a club, and getting a certifictaion, even so I was able to do it all and manage my time well, in the process I was really learning a lot with working with others and having a good time.
